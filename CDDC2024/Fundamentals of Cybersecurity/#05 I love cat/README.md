Challenge Description: 
<Can you try to communicate with 3.1.147.170 on port 10000>

### Solution

Using nc, I communicated with 3.1.147.170 on port 10000 and solved the math question to obtain the flag

`nc 3.1.147.170 10000`


### Flag
CDDC2024{i_l0V3_nE7C4t}


### Reflections
Netcat is a utility that reads and writes data across network connections, using the TCP or UDP protocol. It is designed to be a reliable "back-end" tool, used directly or driven by other programs and scripts. At the same time, it is a feature-rich network debugging and exploration tool since it can create almost any kind of connection you would need and has several interesting built-in capabilities.
